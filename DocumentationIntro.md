# SeqTrace user documentation #

To get started with SeqTrace, you will probably want to first read through the [quick start guide](QuickStartGuide.md), then browse the more in-depth documentation as needed.  If you plan to work on more than a few trace files or want to use SeqTrace's batch processing capabilities, then learning how to effectively [work with SeqTrace projects](WorkingWithProjects.md) will be extremely helpful.
