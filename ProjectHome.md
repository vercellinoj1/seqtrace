SeqTrace is an application for viewing and processing DNA sequencing chromatograms (trace files).  SeqTrace makes it easy to quickly generate high-quality finished sequences from a large number of trace files.  SeqTrace can automatically identify, align, and compute consensus sequences from matching forward and reverse traces, filter low-quality base calls, and perform end trimming of finished sequences.  The finished DNA sequences can then be exported to common sequence file formats, such as FASTA.

SeqTrace also includes a full-featured trace file viewer and editor.  You can view your sequencing chromatograms at a variety of scales and zoom levels, simultaneously view matching forward and reverse traces, edit the called bases, and export individual DNA sequences as well as forward/reverse alignments.  SeqTrace supports popular trace file formats, including ABIF, [SCF](http://staden.sourceforge.net/manual/formats_unix_2.html), and [ZTR](http://staden.sourceforge.net/manual/formats_unix_12.html).

To get started using SeqTrace, see the [quick start guide](QuickStartGuide.md), read the [installation instructions](Installation.md), or browse the [full user documentation](DocumentationIntro.md).

SeqTrace is written in [Python](http://www.python.org/), uses [PyGTK](http://www.pygtk.org/) with the [GTK+](http://www.gtk.org/) windowing toolkit, and runs on most popular operating systems, including GNU/Linux, Windows, and OSX.  I welcome feedback, bug reports, or code contributions from users.  To submit bug reports, please use SeqTrace's [issue tracking system](http://code.google.com/p/seqtrace/issues/list).  To get in touch with me directly, see the [project information page](About.md) to read more about SeqTrace and how to contact me.

### January 14, 2014: SeqTrace 0.9.0 released ###

It's been almost two years since the last release of SeqTrace, and after a lot of work, I'm very pleased to announce that SeqTrace 0.9.0. is now [available](http://code.google.com/p/seqtrace/downloads/list).  This is a significant upgrade that includes many important improvements and new features as well as a few relatively minor bug fixes. I'd like to express my appreciation to all of the users who took the time to give me feedback on SeqTrace 0.8; your ideas and comments were very helpful in deciding what to focus on for 0.9.0.  You can read about all of the new features in SeqTrace 0.9.0 in the [release history](ReleaseHistory.md).

### May 14, 2012: SeqTrace 0.8.1 released ###

SeqTrace 0.8.1 fixes several bugs present in the 0.8.0 release.  For full details, see the [release history](ReleaseHistory.md).
